Chosen sources include information about corresponding authors and their affiliations. Corresponding authors are of special interest here because they are responsible for paying fees associated with gold and hybrid Open Access (OA) publishing. Such data is used in cost estimates for the Charité. However, any author can self-archive a paper (green open access) and thus the total number of papers with a Charité authorship is significant when measuring the percentage of open access reached by the institution as a whole. While the percentage of OA publishing is a key indicator for the visibility and discoverability of research findings, the quality and costs of open access must also be monitored, hence the selection of analyses presented in this dashboard.

## Updates to the dashboard:
Data collection is time consuming and thus happens annually. Metadata describing articles from Web of Science, EMBASE and from the Charité Medical Library (including our Publication Fund) are combined and deduplicated largely by DOI-matching but also involving manual checks especially where DOIs are missing from the data. 

## Choice of timeframe & introducing the analyses:

Data for the years 2018 to 2020 form the basis of the latest predictions for future open access costs for the Charité.

However, since open access status changes and in particular green OA is often delayed, Analysis 1 "Open access status among articles involving Charité authors and among articles with a Charité corresponding author" has been extended back until 2016 to show longer term trends and the potential for future growth of OA.

Analysis 2 "Publishers and journals among articles involving Charité authors, by open access status" shows the most recent publisher and journal choices of Charité authors from 2020 and looks at centrally financed OA-costs over the last three years: the blue chart is clickable to show costs by publisher or by year, showing the steep rise in central costs since the launch of the Publication Fund in 2018 and introduction of DEAL with Wiley in 2019 and SpringerNature in 2020. Actual and complete costs for the institution are likely to be much higher than reported here, since data is currently only available for centrally financed articles. Efforts are being made to complete the picture.

Analysis 3 looks at the use of open licenses over the last three years, according to the open access status of an article. 

## Open Access (OA) status or "color":

The [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/) interface is used to ascertain the open access status of articles via [DOI](LINK: https://www.doi.org/). Green open access is a status which often changes over time due to expiry of publisher embargoes and later author deposits to open access repositories. Definitions for the OA-Status of articles are:

- **Gold:** Published in a journal which is 100% open access and indexed by the [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/).
- **Hybrid:** Published open access with an open license in a journal that hosts a mixture of open access and closed articles.
- **Green:** Published version remains closed, but a free to read copy is available in an OA repository.
- **Bronze:** Published version is free to read, but without an open license (more details below).
- **Closed:** All other articles, including those in hybrid or closed journals.
- **Kein Ergebnis/No result:** status not determined

## Bronze is not true open access:

This is included as a status for the sake of completeness but does not fit the definition of open access from the [Berlin Declaration](https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration), which the Charité is a signatory of. There are two reasons why bronze is not true open access:

- without a clearly identifiable, license, re-use of the article is either not permitted or relies on individual enquiries.
- long term free access is not supported, since publishers can withdraw free access at any time and without a license, repository copies cannot be archived.

Similarly, as shown in Analysis 3, most green open access publishing also happens without a clearly identifiable license but at least free access is granted for the long term. 

## Open Licenses:
These are determined using data from [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/). Articles may be available under more than one license but a [hierarchy of licenses](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) is used, so that only the least restrictive, and most open licenses are counted in the analysis in this dashboard.
